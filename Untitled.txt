Can you look at the Oralable and the Oraablefordentists apps. They communicate with each other. The Oralablefordentistis tracks different patients. For each patient the Dentist should be able to see the exact same Dashboard and Historical screens as the patient. Because the dentist isn’t connected to the device he doesn’t need to see any of the other screens particular to the patients, that is the devices screen and sharing screen the settings screen. Can you look into this and tell me what you understand
